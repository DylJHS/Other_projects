- Going over the specs that adi requested
- Different time points in CBX vs NLS
- plots will be created by time point
- Columns that are needed are: 
	* all NLS, CBX time points 
	* -log10pval 
	* foldchange
	* Gene names
- Plots do not need to be facetted or wrapped


01/05/25
- Requirements are: 
	* R script
	* Plots in pdf format
	* X-axis: log2 fold change.
	* Y-axis: -log10 p-value
	* Label and highlight: NLS on the left side. CBX1 on the right side.
	* Both in bold and a distinct colour.
	* dotted lines for FC & pval cutoffs
	* highlight thresholded points in one colour
	* highlight genes of interest in another colour
	* highlight genes of interest with label
	* highlight control genes in diff colour
	
- The genes of interest include: "PRDM2", "ZNF584", "C5orf24", "SP140L", "SCMH1", "CBX4", "SMARCAL1", "TEAD3", "PRDM10", "ZNF219", "ZNF644", "ZNF384"
- FoldChange values in the dataset are calculated as the difference in mean intensities between the CBX1 and NLS conditions


02/05/25
- Script calculates the log2FC bsaed on the mean of the cbx1 and nls columns 
- Uses the log2FC as the x axis foldchange
- Plot is saved as pdf

25/06/25
- Issues with the script were observed
- It calculates the log2 fold change using the means fo the replicates from each group but the replicate values are already in log2 form
- Furthermore, the analysis was already performed using a dedicated model (file:///C:/Users/dhaynessimmons/Downloads/RMD_Volcano_PD_noRibosome%20(1).html)
- Requested modifications: 
	- Update X-axis (log₂ fold change):Use correct fold change values showing higher enrichment (as seen in the HTML plot).
	- Split screen hits into two categories: In cellulo hits (PRDM2, ZNF584, C5orf24, SP140L, SCMH1, CBX4) Use one fill colour + bold/bright border; In vitro hits (ZNF384, TEAD3, ZNF219, SMARCAL1, PRDM10) Use a different fill colour, same border style. Both sets should be labelled and distinguished in the legend.
	- Update control genes: Add ZNF644 to the control set (blue dot). Add CBX1 to the control set.
	- New category: Known interactors (MIS12, TRIM28, EHMT2, SETDB1, ADNP2, LBR) Highlight and label the following with a new colour: Include as a separate legend entry: “Known interactors”.
- no border parameter for the points in EnhancedVolcano so slight change of colour between goi_cellulo and goi_vitro
- updated the plot to inclue the changes

26/06/25
- Changed the log2FC to 4
