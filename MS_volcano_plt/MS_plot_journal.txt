- Going over the specs that adi requested
- Different time points in CBX vs NLS
- plots will be created by time point
- Columns that are needed are: 
	* all NLS, CBX time points 
	* -log10pval 
	* foldchange
	* Gene names
- Plots do not need to be facetted or wrapped


01/05/25
- Requirements are: 
	* R script
	* Plots in pdf format
	* X-axis: log2 fold change.
	* Y-axis: -log10 p-value
	* Label and highlight: NLS on the left side. CBX1 on the right side.
	* Both in bold and a distinct colour.
	* dotted lines for FC & pval cutoffs
	* highlight thresholded points in one colour
	* highlight genes of interest in another colour
	* highlight genes of interest with label
	* highlight control genes in diff colour
	
- The genes of interest include: "PRDM2", "ZNF584", "C5orf24", "SP140L", "SCMH1", "CBX4", "SMARCAL1", "TEAD3", "PRDM10", "ZNF219", "ZNF644", "ZNF384"
- FoldChange values in the dataset are calculated as the difference in mean intensities between the CBX1 and NLS conditions


02/05/25
- Script calculates the log2FC bsaed on the mean of the cbx1 and nls columns 
- Uses the log2FC as the x axis foldchange
- Plot is saved as pdf
