- Going over the specs that adi requested
- Different time points in CBX vs NLS
- plots will be created by time point
- Columns that are needed are: 
	* all NLS, CBX time points 
	* -log10pval 
	* foldchange
	* Gene names
- Plots do not need to be facetted or wrapped

- Requirements are: 
	* R script
	* Plots in pdf format
	* X-axis: log2 fold change.
	* Y-axis: -log10 p-value
	* Label and highlight: NLS on the left side. CBX1 on the right side.
	* Both in bold and a distinct colour.
	* dotted lines for FC & pval cutoffs
	* highlight thresholded points in one colour
	* highlight genes of interest in another colour
